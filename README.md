##This is a project I did in the 9-week Front-End BootCamp at HackerYou.

The project was to take a single page PSD design that had be sliced up and presented 
to us as sliced assets and convert the design into a fully-responsive static website. 
This was the week we learned FlexBox layouts as well as Sass.
